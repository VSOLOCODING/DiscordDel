Tool Requirements

DM Delete:
Discord Token
User ID (Works for Group Chats as well)
------------------------------------------
Server Delete:
Discord Token
Server ID (Guild)
Channel ID
--------------------------
Important Settings

Set the deletion rate to 0.3-0.7 messages per second to avoid hitting Discord's rate limits (Error 429).
Only if you want to quickly delete your message and close your account put it to 3-10 rate,

if you use my suggestion for 0.3-0.7 for ever 100 message it was take 2-7 mins.(depending on the internet as well.)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How it Works

The tool connects to Discord’s API over the internet to delete messages, servers, or users automatically.

Completely Free.

Why I Made This Tool:

I’m 14 and use Discord, but I got frustrated after having to manually delete each message one by one.
I tried online tools, but they cost money, so I used my coding skills to create this free tool after some research.
